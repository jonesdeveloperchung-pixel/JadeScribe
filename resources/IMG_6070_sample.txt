### 🌿 Chosen Jade Pendant

**Item code: PA-0425_AF**

I’ve selected the pendant located on the **bottom row, center** of the tray.

This piece is a **deep, moss-green jade pendant**, carved into the serene form of **Guanyin**, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. The jade has a gentle translucency, allowing light to soften its surface and reveal subtle variations in tone—darker greens pooling in the deeper folds of the carving, lighter hues glowing along the raised contours.

Guanyin’s expression is calm and introspective, with flowing robes that cascade gracefully down the body, giving the pendant a sense of quiet movement despite its solid form. The carving is smooth and well-balanced, suggesting careful craftsmanship and reverence for traditional symbolism. Suspended from a simple metal fitting, the pendant feels understated yet deeply meaningful—an object meant not just for adornment, but for **protection, mercy, and inner peace**.

Worn close to the heart, this pendant evokes tranquility and compassion, making it a timeless companion for both daily wear and spiritual reflection.
